# Vue & ExpressJs final project

This is our A-grade final project in my web-development course implemented in Vue and ExpressJs. It's a fully functional, simple and secure Queue system. The focus of this project is to implement modern basic features and security principles of modern web-development. Anything but a minimalistic visual presentation was outside the scope of this project.

This project implements features like:

* 📣 Real-time updates using sockets
* 🍪 Support HTTPS-certificates and secure cookies
* 🚪 Gated API's and privileged users
* 🔐 Encrypted passwords with [bcrypt](https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js)
* 🕗 Persistent sessions w/ timeouts
* 🚀 Simple, well-structured codebase
